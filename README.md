Repository testing predicting accurate minor isotopologue energies utilising major isotopologue experimental (MARVEL) values, major isotopologue calculated values (TROVE), and minor isotopologue calculated values (TROVE).


Repository based on other quantum number (QN) neural network (NN) work I have previously done with CO2.
